#Basic Counter Program

This project is a simple web-based counter application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a large number displayed on the screen and three buttons below it: “Decrease”, “Reset”, and “Increase”. The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript and DOM manipulation in a real-world setting.

Features

	•	Increase: Adds 1 to the current counter value.
	•	Decrease: Subtracts 1 from the current counter value.
